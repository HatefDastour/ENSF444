        "## Line Plot\n",
        "\n",
        "A line plot is a common type of data visualization that displays data points connected by straight lines. It is particularly useful for visualizing trends, changes over time, and the relationship between two numerical variables. Both Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in Python offer functions to create line plots with various features and customizations. Here's an explanation of how to use `matplotlib.pyplot.plot()` and `seaborn.lineplot()`:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Usage**: Line plots are used to show the trend or progression of a variable over a continuous axis, such as time, while connecting the data points to visualize the overall pattern or trajectory.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Matplotlib Library**: Matplotlib is a low-level data visualization library in Python that provides a wide range of plotting functions and options. `matplotlib.pyplot.plot()` is the basic function for creating line plots with Matplotlib. You can see the full function description [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Seaborn Library**: Seaborn is a high-level data visualization library in Python that is built on top of Matplotlib. Seaborn offers more advanced and interactive plotting functions and aesthetics. `seaborn.lineplot()` is the function for creating line plots with Seaborn. You can see the full function description [here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.lineplot.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Syntax**:\n",
        "  - The basic syntax for creating a line plot with Matplotlib is: `matplotlib.pyplot.plot(x, y, fmt, **kwargs)`. Here, `x` and `y` are the variables to be plotted on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. `fmt` is an optional parameter that specifies the format of the line and markers, such as color, style, and shape. `**kwargs` are additional keyword arguments that control the appearance and behavior of the plot.\n",
        "  - The basic syntax for creating a line plot with Seaborn is: `seaborn.lineplot(x, y, data, hue, style, markers, **kwargs)`. Here, `x` and `y` are the variables to be plotted on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. `data` is the DataFrame containing the data. `hue`, `style`, and `markers` are optional parameters that allow you to differentiate lines based on categorical variables and customize the appearance of the lines and data points. `**kwargs` are additional keyword arguments that control the appearance and behavior of the plot.\n",
        "5. **Features and Customization**: Both Matplotlib and Seaborn provide various features and customization options for line plots, such as setting plot aesthetics (line colors, styles, marker types), adding labels and titles, adjusting axis limits, and more. Seaborn also offers some additional features, such as coloring lines based on categorical variables, adding confidence intervals around the lines, and smoothing the lines with a kernel density estimate.\n",
        "6. **Interpretation**: When interpreting a line plot, focus on the overall trend of the line, any significant changes or inflection points, the relative behavior of different lines (if using `hue`), and the variability or dispersion of the data points around the line.\n",
        "7. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that the data is properly organized and relevant for the line plot. Handle missing values and ensure that the variables being plotted on the x-axis and y-axis are suitable for a line plot (typically numerical variables)."
